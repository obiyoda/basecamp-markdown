# Privacy Policy

**Basecamp Markdown Renderer** does not collect, store, or transmit any user data.

## Data Collection

This extension:
- Does **not** collect any personal information
- Does **not** track your browsing activity
- Does **not** make any external network requests
- Does **not** use analytics or telemetry
- Does **not** store any data outside your browser

## How It Works

The extension runs entirely locally in your browser. It reads content on Basecamp pages to detect markdown in code blocks and renders it as formatted HTML. All processing happens on your device — nothing is sent anywhere.

## Permissions

The extension only requires access to `*.basecamp.com` pages to function. No other permissions are requested.
